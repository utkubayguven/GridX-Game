## Introduction

GridX is an addictive puzzle game developed using Unity (Version 2019.4.16f1). In this game, your goal is to strategically place X symbols on a grid and eliminate groups of three or more adjacent X symbols. It's a simple yet challenging game that tests your spatial reasoning and puzzle-solving skills.

## Gameplay

- Upon launching the game, you are presented with a grid of cells.
- Click on any empty cell within the grid to place an X symbol.
- Whenever three or more X symbols appear in a row (horizontally or vertically), those symbols are eliminated from the grid.
- Clear the grid by strategically placing X symbols to create groups and trigger eliminations.
- Earn points for each X symbol eliminated and aim for a high score.
- The game continues until there are no more possible moves or until you reach a specific objective.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: The game allows you to specify the size of the grid. Enter an integer value (n) to create an n x n grid.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Easily place X symbols by clicking on the cells within the grid.
- **Symbol Elimination**: Groups of three or more adjacent X symbols are automatically eliminated from the grid, creating a satisfying chain reaction.
- **Responsive UI**: The game's user interface adjusts to the size of the grid, ensuring it fits perfectly on your screen.
- **Reusable Cells**: Once X symbols are eliminated, the cells become empty and can be reused for future placements.
